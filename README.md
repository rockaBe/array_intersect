# Kata like challenge

This challenge is to see how applicants understand requirements and implement a nice solution in nice code.

## Background

As a developer, you should be able to calculate the `intersects` of two arrays (`a1`, `a2`) so that the following criterias are met:
  
  1. all elements, that occur in both arrays, are available in the resulting array.
  2. the resulting array should be sorted

### main task  

Implement an `intersect` method, without using the built in `#intersect` method of the class `Array`, that takes 2 arrays as arguments  
`a1 = [3,3,1,3]` and  
`a2 = [1,2,3,3]` and  

returns `[1,3]`.

### nice to have task 

Implement the `intersect` method same as above, but elements commonly appearing multiple times in both arrays should be reflected in the result.

E.g.  
`a1 = [3,3,1,3]` and  
`a2 = [1,2,3,3]` and  
returns `[1,3,3]` (have a look at the digit `3` appearing twice in the result).

### talk us through while you implement this

We want to understand how you approach the task and be able to follow, so speaking out your thoughts, helps us understand you better.

Please provide also considerations about e.g. performance, O-notation etc.
