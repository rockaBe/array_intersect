# Simple kata like challenge

This challenge is to see how applicants understand requirements and implement a nice solution in nice code.

## Background

As a developer, you should be able to calculate the `intersects` of two arrays (`a1`, `a2`) so that the following criterias are met:
  1. all elements that occur in both arrays are available in the resulting array.
  2. the minimum count of occurences of an element in both arrays can be found in the resulting array (e.g. `intersect([1,1,2], [1,1,1])` should return `result = [1,1]`).
  3. the resulting array should be sorted

## The task

Implement a `intersect` method that takes 2 arrays as arguments `a1 = [6,3,8,1,3,1,2,4,3]` and `a2 = [2,3,7,3,1,4,4,4,4]` and returns `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`.
Please provide a short description on your thoughts (about e.g. performance, O-notation etc.)
